# Chaos-in-a-phase-oscillator-systems-with-higher-order-interactions-communities-and-phase-lags
This file contains codes for Chaos in a phase oscillator systems with higher order interactions, communities, and phase lags. This repository contains codes for timeseries plots of order parameters (in both polar equations and complex equations), bifurcation plots, plots for basin of attracttion, lyapunov exponents and lyapunov dimension calculations.
