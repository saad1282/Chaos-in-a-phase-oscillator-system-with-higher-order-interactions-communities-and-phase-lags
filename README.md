# Chaos-in-a-phase-oscillator-systems-with-higher-order-interactions-communities-and-phase-lags

This file contains codes for Chaos in a phase oscillator systems with higher order interactions, communities, and phase lags. The files under this repository are:

1. timeseries_order_parameters: Generate timeseries of order parameters using complex or polar equations. This file generates Figs. 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 5, 10
2. Kuramoto_model_phaselags_simulation: Simulation of the Kuramoto model of phase lagged oscillator system. This file generates Figs 2d, 2e, 2f
3. Final_bifurcation_for_plots.: This file generates bifurcation diagrams, Figs. 3, 5a, 7, 9a
4. bifurcation_bistability_figure_simulation: This file gives generates bifurcation and bistability figures, Figs 4, 5a, 7. The data used in this file are inside the Data folder.
5. Basin2.m: This file generates basin of attraction, Fig. 8.
6. plot_basin_blanca_files: This file generates basin of attraction if data file is given. The data file used in this efile is inside the Data folder.
7. Lyapunov_qr_our_system: Calculates Lyapunov exponents and local maxima and minima. Generates to generate Figs. 3, 5, 9
8. Lyapunov dimension: Plots Lyapunov Exponents and calculates Lyapunov dimension. Generates Figs. 5b, 5c, 9b. The data file used in this code is included in Data folder.
